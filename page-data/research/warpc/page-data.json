Our objective is effective even in settings with large appearance and view-point changes.\nGiven a pair of real images, we first construct an image triplet by applying a randomly sampled warp to one of the original images.\nWe derive and analyze all flow-consistency constraints arising between the triplet. From our observations and empirical results, we design a general unsupervised objective employing two of the derived constraints.\nWe validate our warp consistency loss by training three recent dense correspondence networks for the geometric and semantic matching tasks. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarks, including MegaDepth, RobotCar and TSS. Code and models will be released <a href=\"https://github.com/PruneTruong/DenseMatching\">here</a>. </p>\n<h2>How to cite:</h2>\n<pre><code>@inproceedings{warpc,\n  author    = {Prune Truong and\n               Martin Danelljan and\n               Fisher Yu and \n               Luc Van Gool},\n  title     = {Warp Consistency for Unsupervised Learning of Dense Correspondences},\n  year      = {2021},\n  url       = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03308}\n}\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-06-15","path":"/research/warpc","title":"Warp Consistency","links":[{"type":"arxiv","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03308"},{"type":"github","link":"https://github.com/PruneTruong/DenseMatching"}]},"timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Warp Consistency for Unsupervised Learning of Dense Correspondences Prune Truong             Martin Danelljan            Fisher Yu…"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["4181098705"]}
